Phishing website detection and benchmarking

This projects aims to benchmark current tools available for classifying a url as phishing or not and further benchmark the results of the tools we examined on several industry datasets.

We also propose a new neural network which is trained using a bidirectional LSTM as a newer option to classify a url as phishing website or not.
